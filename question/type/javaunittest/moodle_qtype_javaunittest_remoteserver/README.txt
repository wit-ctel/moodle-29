 ==========================================================

1. Installation and configuration

    Put the the directory 'javaunittest' and its content into your
    moodle directory: moodle/question/type/.
    
    Decide whether using local compiling and test running or using a remote server.
    If you chose remote running put the content of the directory
    'moodle_qtype_javaunittest_remoteserver' to your remote machine.
    
    Configure the plugin settings via admin settings page.
    Furthermore if necessary configure the remote server by editing the config.php.
    
    The compiling and test running machine needs beside the webserver with
    php support of course java compiler, java runtime environment and a current
    versions of junit and hamcrest (get them from 
    https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Download-and-Install).
    
==========================================================

2. JUnit examples

    In the sub directory EXAMPLE_FILES you find some examples and another 
    README file. It explains how to create a question with this question 
    type module.

==========================================================

3. Security Manager

    The java security manager has the task to prevent any evil
    things who could mess up your system. This plugin supports
    the usage of the java security manager. There is a polfile to
    configure things who are allowed. E.g. if you need to grant 
    threading privileges or file i/o edit this polfile.
    Policy files should be stored in the polfiles directory.
    
    Note that the remote server has its own polfiles directory.

5. Important Note for Usage

    Please remember that any kind of software may have bugs. This also involves the
    Java Compiler, Run Time Enviroment and Security Manager, the Webserver, PHP,
    all the other components, and of course this Moodle plugin too. We made this plugin
    secure to our best of knowledge but we can not guarantee that nothing goes wrong.

        + added debug settings
        # 2.8 and 2.9 are supported

                feedbacklevel
            # feedback levels: nothing, times, times and counts (tests, failures), all
